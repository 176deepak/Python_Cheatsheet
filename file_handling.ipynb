    "# FILE HANDLING\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling in Python refers to the ability to work with files on your computer's filesystem. Python provides a rich set of tools and modules to interact with files, allowing you to perform various operations such as reading, writing, appending, and manipulating files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a file\n",
    "2. Perform operation on file(read, write etc.)\n",
    "3. Close the file"
